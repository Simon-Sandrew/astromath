# astromath
// AstroMath Project for HackRPI2021:
// Created By: Edgar Valle, Simon Sandrew, Tommy Bird, and Yash Kaul

Inspiration:

Our design was inspired by existing websites – like Nitro Type – which challenges the user to type as fast as they possibly can. We thought, why don't we do this for math?

Despite being enrolled in hard classes like Multivariable Calculus, there are still times where we can get tripped up by small, even elementary math problems. Learning to remove these small hiccups would be fantastic.

What it does:

The game trains you in efficiently solving problems, wherein each level of the game is a new planet. Upon making it to another planet, you are presented with harder questions that go up in grade level (e.g. addition on planet 1, then ratios on planet 4). The 9 levels follow the solar systems 8 planets plus Pluto, wherein you are presented with college-level math.

How we built it:

The front end is done in HTML, and the back end is Javascript (a majority of the code). This lot is hosted on Netlify.

We also used Google Cloud to store user data, such as their name and high score. On our Cloud SQL database, we update it using Python scripts.

Luckily domain.com was able to provide us astromath.tech which tied the project together nicely.

Challenges we ran into:

Working with a real-time online database created a few difficulties, but we persevered.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:

We're pretty satisfied with our product and learned a lot about JavaScript, Google Cloud, and HTML through this project!

What's next for AstroMath:

Mobile potentially coming soon?
